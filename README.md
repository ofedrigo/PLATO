PLATO
=====

Partial Likelihoods Assessed Through Optimisation (PLATO):
Grassly, N. C., and E. C. Holmes. 1997. A likelihood method for the detection of selection and recombination using nucleotide sequences. Mol. biol. Evol. 14: 239-247.
Basically, this method looks for regions of the alignment that have a lesser fit to a given model of evolution, compared to the rest of the alignment. 
I re-implemented PLATO in order to incorporate more models.
